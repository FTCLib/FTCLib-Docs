# Support FTCLib

FTCLib is solely community-driven and currently is not the standard tool for programming in FTC. In order to get to that point, we need to garner a large audience. If you have worked with our library, consider using some of our branding tools that you can find under the [brand package](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib/tree/dev/brand) in our repository. Spreading news by word of mouth also works and make sure to point them towards [our website](http://ftclib.org).

You can use our logo to put a sticker on your robot as seen here:

We would also greatly appreciate it if you would contribute to FTCLib. Make sure to read our [contributing page](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) on the GitHub for information on how to contribute.
